*Subject* MySQL Database Insurance

Hello,

Everyone has horror stories about a database broken by a bad query. A single mistake breaks your application for hours, days, or even months. Just google what happened to Atlassian or I'd be happy to send you some links.

Dolt solves this problem with a special type of replica you add to an existing MySQL deployment. No migration required.

Contact us to learn more about how Dolt replication can safeguard your database.

Hello,

Are you running a MySQL type database and worried about what happens when an admin runs a destructive query?

It can cause the deletion, modification, or alteration of data in the database. This can result in data loss, data corruption, or other problems that can disrupt the functionality of the database and the systems that depend on it.

Add a Dolt replica and stop worrying.

*New Subject* Your Database Backups are Broken

Hi,

They aren't really broken but they aren't working as hard they could be. What happens where there is a destructive query? You can restore to certain point in time but you lose all of the work between your current state and whatever backup you restored from. 

Dolt solves these problems.

*New Subject* Database Horror Stories

Hi,

Everyone has or atleast heard of database horror story. A bad query corrupts data, an operator error drops a table, or maybe script is update the wrong tables. 

If you are lucky, its an easy fix. That is not always the case and sometimes it can take [months](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-14-atlassian-outage-prevention/) and play out the public eye.

Until now the best option was to restore from a backup, but Dolt changes that. Dolt verison controls your backups down to cell level to make disaster recovery  much easier.
