*Subject* MySQL Database Insurance

Hello,

Everyone has horror stories about a database broken by a bad query. A single mistake breaks your application for hours, days, or even months. Just Google what happened to JIRA at Atlassian or I'd be happy to send some links.

Dolt solves this problem with a special type of replica you add to an existing MySQL deployment. No migration required. You get an audit log of every cell, time travel, and branch for development on a replica. No risk to production. Imagine how much easier life would have been at Atlassian if they had one of these.

Contact us to learn more about how Dolt replication can safeguard your database.

Hello,

I'm sure you are busy. I'm bumping my first email. I thought you should know that a solution exists that makes it easy to version control your existing MySQL database to make your backups more powerful with an audit log of every cell, time travel, and branches for development on a replica.

 Let me know if you'd like to talk our CEO and founder about this.

*New Subject* A bad query in prod
Hello,

Are you running a MySQL type database and worried about what happens when an admin runs a destructive query?

It can cause the deletion, modification, or alteration of data in the database. This can result in data loss, data corruption, or other problems that can disrupt the functionality of the database and the systems that depend on it.

Add a Dolt replica and stop worrying. You get an audit log of every cell between versions, time travel, and branch for development on a replica. No risk to production.

*New Subject*  Better Database Backups

Hi,

Your MySQL backups aren't working as hard they could be. What happens when there is a destructive query? You can restore to certain point in time but you lose all of the work between your current state and whatever backup you restored from. 

Dolt solves these problems.

Reply to this email to learn how can you version control your backups.

*New Subject* Database Horror Stories

Hi,

Everyone has or at least heard of a database horror story. A bad query corrupts data, an operator drops a table, or maybe script updates the wrong tables. 

If you are lucky, its an easy fix. That is not always the case and sometimes it can take [months](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2022-04-14-atlassian-outage-prevention/) and play out the public eye.

Until now the best option was to restore from a backup, but Dolt changes that. Dolt verison controls your backups down to cell level to make disaster recovery  much easier.

*subject* Version Controlled MySQL Replica

What if your database acted just like a Git repo? Imagine an audit log of every cell, time travel, and branches for development.

Destructive query? Just roll back to the previous working state, debug prod with diffs, and create a patch. 

A Dolt database replica gives you all of that. A small edition to your stack, no migration required.

Would you like to learn how to set this up?

Here is a link to our [blog](https://www.dolthub.com/blog/2023-03-15-getting-started-versioned-mysql-replica/) on the setup a version controlled MySQL replica and few use cases.

*subject* Version Controlled MySQL Replica

What are your biggest database worries?  Everyone has heard stories about a bad query that broke production for hours or days. Sure you have logs and backups for recovery but they are limited. 

Now imagine that your database backup behaved like a Git repo: diffs created by every write query, an audit log of every cell, and instantaneous rollbacks.

Destructive query? Just roll back to the previous working state, debug prod with diffs, and create a patch. Downtime is now minutes instead of hours or days. 

A Dolt database replica gives you all of that with about 15 minutes of work. 

Happy to share more if you're interested.

Thoughts on above?

Dolt can version control your existing MySQL databases without any changes to your stack. So you get data lineage, diffs, SQL patches, branches, better logs, etc. It's essentially a better database backup that you can set up in 15 minutes. Almost like database insurance.
