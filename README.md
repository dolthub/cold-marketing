# Cold-Marketing
This is for [DoltHub's](https://www.dolthub.com/) cold email marketing outreach to develop Dolt use cases and messaging that will lead to more Dolt users and sales.

## Email best practices
* Keep emails to 100 words or less
* Subjects should be short and relevant to the recipient
* Links can hurt email deliverability. Use sparingly 
* Customize your email to the ICP
* CTA should be simple and non-binding
* Reuse content but change subjects and CTAs

## Requirements
* Include at least one follow-up email
* Send 100 emails per campaign 
* Define your market for the email
  * Example
   > * Industry - Banking
   > * Company Size < $50 million in revenue 
   > * Location = USA
   > * Email recipient = VP of eng
   > * Dolt Pitch/Problem we solve = What happens when your customer database has an operator error
