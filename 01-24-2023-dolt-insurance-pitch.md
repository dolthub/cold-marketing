Hello,

Are you running a MySQL type database and worried about what happens when an admin runs a destructive query?

It can cause the deletion, modification, or alteration of data in the database. This can result in data loss, data corruption, or other problems that can disrupt the functionality of the database and the systems that depend on it.
