The answer is usually bad code or data. Thanks to version control software like Git, your team can find the bad code and fix it. 

But what if it's the data?  That is a more challenging problem. Was it a bad internal update? Wrong information from a trusted vendor? A bad transformation? Maybe a fat-fingered entry?

What if you had the power to figure out exactly what data changed, who or what changed it, and when it happened just like you do with your code? Dolt gives you that power.
